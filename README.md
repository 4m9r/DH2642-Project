# DH2642-Project
Project for the course  Interaction Programming and the Dynamic Web (DH2642)

Movies are often a major talking point amongst friends and family.
Our project presents FILM BUFF, an application that helps people discover movies and knowledge about those movies in a more fun and interactive way!

Film Buff helps users search for movies based on popularity, genre, etc. Additionally:
  - Users can create lists of their favourite movies
  - Users can create an account
  - Users can get recommendations of movies they might like based on a movie selection
  - Users can search a movie and see the details of it
  - There will be quizzes about random movies with a leaderboard system so the users can compete with each other
  - Users can see the lists that have been created by others 
  - Users can make their own lists and collaborate on them if they want
